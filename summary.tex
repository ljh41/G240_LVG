\section{SUMMARY}\label{summary}

We have presented a CO multi-transition study towards the molecular outflow of the high-mass star-forming region \objectname{G240}. With the LVG analysis, we have constrained the temperatures to $\sim$ 50 K and found a decreasing trend of CO column density with gas velocity. We also constrain the H$_2$ density to values higher than $n \sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. With the RD analysis, we found similar results in the temperature and the CO column density.
