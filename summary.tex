\section{Summary}\label{summary}

Using the APEX CO J = 3-2, 6-5 and 7-6 observations and the complementary CO J = 2-1 data, we have presented the first CO multi-transition study toward the molecular outflow of the high-mass star-forming region \objectname{G240}. The parsec-sized, bipolar, and high velocity outflow is clearly revealed by the CO J = 3-2, 6-5 and 7-6 emissions. For both lobes, the outflow is approximately isothermal with a temperature of $\sim$ 50 K. The outflowing gas is thermalized with a H$_2$ density higher than $n \sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. The CO column density of the outflow decreases with gas velocity., which indicates that the gas density decreases with outflow velocity when the CO abundance and velocity gradient remain relatively constant. The isothermal state and the decreasing gas density indicate that the wind-driven/entrainment is the dominant driving mechanism of the G240 outflow. This finding further suggests that disk-accretion can be responsible for the formation of high-mass stars more massive than early B-type stars.

%The CO 7-6/6-5, 6-5/3-2, and 6-5/2-1 line ratios are remarkably constant with the outflow velocity.
