\section{SUMMARY}\label{summary}

We have presented a CO multi-transition (CO 2-1, 3-2, 6-5, 7-6) study towards the molecular outflow of the high-mass star-forming region \objectname{G240}. The morphologies seen in four lines are very similar. With the LVG analysis, we have constrained the temperatures to $\sim$ 50 K and found a decreasing trend of CO column density with gas velocity. We also constrain the H$_2$ density to values higher than $n \sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and found that the outflowing gas is thermalized. With the RD analysis, we found similar results in the temperature and the CO column density. The T-V relation of the G240 outflow agrees well with the wide-angle wind-driven model. Assuming a constant CO abundance
ratio and a constant velocity gradient, we detect a decreasing gas density with velocity, which is also consistent with the wide-angle wind-driven model.
