\section{SUMMARY}\label{summary}

We have presented CO multi line observations toward high mass star forming region \objectname{G240}. With the LVG analysis, we have constrained the temperatures to $\sim$ 50 K and the H$_2$ density to values higher than $n \sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ towards the outflow associated with \objectname{G240}. We also find a decreasing trend of CO column density with gas velocity.
