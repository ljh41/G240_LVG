\subsection{Gas temperature}
%High sensitivity CO mid-J observations as complements of existed low-J observations are required to constrain the temperature and density of the molecular outflows as a function of velocity, while these mid-J observations are challenging because of atmospheric limits. 
%A rising CO 3-2/6-5 ratio is observed towards the outflow associated with low-mass YSO HH 46 IRS 1\citep{2009A&A...501..633V}. With the density assumed to be constant, the rising ratios at more extreme velocities correspond to lower kinetic temperatures.
%The CO 3-2/6-5 ratios of the outflow associated with low-mass protostars NGC 1333 IRAS 4A and 4B were found to be relatively constant with velocity \citep{2012A&A...542A..86Y}. With the assumption of constant densities, \citet{2012A&A...542A..86Y} suggests that the constant ratios indicate little or no temperature change with velocity. With the assumption of constant canonical CO fractional abundances and constant velocity gradients, \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} performed an LVG analysis on the extremely high velocity outflow associated with the high-mass YSO G5.89-0.39 in CO 2-1 and CO 3-2 and found an increasing trend of temperature with outflow velocity.

The morphology and kinematics of molecular outflows have been widely studied based on single spectral line observations. However, the physical conditions of the outflow gas are still not well constrained. In paticular, how the physical conditions vary with the outflow velocity is poorly understood. \citet{2009A&A...501..633V} and \citet{2012A&A...542A..86Y} performed LVG calculations on single-dish CO J = 3-2 and 6-5 lines, and suggested that there is little or no temperature change within outflow velocity ranges of $<10-15$ km s$^{-1}$ in the outflow associated with low-mass protostars HH46 IRS1 and NGC 1333 IRAS 4A/4B. With interferometer CO J = 2-1 and 3-2 observations, \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} performed an LVG analysis on the extremely high velocity outflow associated with the high-mass star-forming region G5.89-0.39, and found an increasing temperature with outflow velocity for outflow velocity $<$ 160 km s$^{-1}$. Based on the variation of the CO 2-1/1-0 line ratio and assuming LTE, \citet{2018RAA....18...19X} found that the excitation temperature of the outflow of the massive star-forming region IRAS 22506+5944 increases from low ($\sim 5$ km s$^{-1}$) to moderate ($\sim8-12$ km s$^{-1}$) velocities, and then decrease at higher velocities ($<30$ km s$^{-1}$). In these works, assumptions about other outflow parameters (e.g. gas density, canonical CO fractional abundance and velocity gradient) or the equilibrium state (e.g. LTE) were made to infer the $T$-$V$ relations from only two CO lines, while these assumptions might not be necessarily valid. Other than that, the last two works have only used low-J CO lines with small energy ranges, which are not sufficient to trace the relatively warm and dense gas. To more precisely determine the outflow properties, multi-line CO studies with sophisticated radiative transfer methods (e.g. LVG analysis) are needed. Recently, \citet{2015A&A...581A...4L} performed a multi-transition CO analysis on the outflow cavity ($<40$ km s$^{-1}$) of the intermediate-mass Class 0 protostar Cepheus E-mm and revealed two gas components: the low-excitation component traced by CO transitions of $J_{up} \le 9$ is isothermal, and an increasing temperature of velocity is found in the high-excitation gas component traced by high-J CO transitions (with $J_{up}$ up to 16). Our analysis reveals that the G240 outflow, which is representative of a well-defined bipolar wide-angle molecular outflow in a $> 10^4 L_\sun$ star-forming region \citep{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, is approximately isothermal with a gas temperature of $\sim$ 50 K within a outflow velocity range of 23 km s$^{-1}$. This isothermal state is similar to the behavior of outflows (traced by CO transitions of $J_{up} \le 9$) associated with low-mass and intermediate-mass protostars \citep{2012A&A...542A..86Y, 2015A&A...581A...4L}, and the temperature of $\sim$ 50 K is slightly lower than temperature constraints for outflows of low-mass protostars \citep{2009A&A...501..633V, 2012A&A...542A..86Y} and intermediate-mass protostars \citep{2016A&A...587A..17V}. The derived outflow temperature is warmer than the previously adopted $\sim$ 30 K \citep{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, which indicates that the physical parameters (mass, momentum, energy) of the G240 outflow calculated by \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q} were underestimated by a factor of 1.32. 

%Using the CO 6-5, 7-6 and (16-15) lines, \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} performed a rotation diagram analysis towards the G5.89-0.39 outflow and found a decreasing trend of temperature with increasing velocities. \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} argued that this disagreement seen in results of \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} and \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} could be due to different angular resolutions and different energy range. However, with only two or three lines observed, their derived $T-V$ relations must be deduced from fixing other physical parameters, e.g., constant density or constant canonical CO fractional abundance, or from the assumption that the different transitions can be discribed with the same excitation temperature (LTE), while these assumptions might deviate from the real case.

\subsection{Gas density and CO column density}\label{subsec:density}
Figure \ref{fig:figrelation} shows that, from $\sim \pm$ 7 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim \pm$ 22 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the cloud velocity, the beam-averaged CO column density decreases by a factor of 50. In the optically thin case, the CO column density $N$ is related to the gas density $n$ through the expression: 
\begin{equation}
N = n \times \Delta V \times \frac{1}{dv/dr} \times X_{\mathrm{CO}} \times f_{\mathrm{b}}, 
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the beam filling factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}}$ the [CO]/[H$_2$] abundance ratio, $\Delta V$ the velocity interval and $dv/dr$ is the velocity gradient. The CO column density is degenerate with the beam filling factor, the velocity gradient and the abundance ratio. Assuming a constant CO abundance ratio, which is adopted by most previous works, the decreasing beam-averaged CO column density indicate a decline of beam-averaged gas column density with velocity. Since the beam filling factor only decreases by a factor of $\sim$ 2.5 within the outflow velocity range (derived from source sizes of $\sim 20\arcsec$ to $\sim 10\arcsec$, see Figure 3 of \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q}), it plays a minor role in the above relation. If the velocity gradient do not vary much, the variation of the beam-averaged CO column density and the beam filling factor indicates that the gas density decreases with velocity, and that the gas density is $>$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at the lowest outflow velocity. This gas density limit is comparable to the density of the low excitation component in the outflow cavity associated with Cepheus E-mm \citep[Several times of 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$:][]{2015A&A...581A...4L}.

%N = n \times \Delta V \times \frac{1}{dv/dr} \times X_{\mathrm{CO}} \times f_{\mathrm{b}}, 
%the beam-filling factor decreases from $\sim$ 0.5 down to $\sim$ 0.2 (derived from source sizes of $\sim 20\arcsec$ to $\sim 10\arcsec$, see Figure 3 of \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q}). The beam-averaged CO column density at the lowest flow velocity is 50 times larger than that at the highest flow velocity, whereas the beam filling factor is only 2.5 times larger. The lower limit of the gas density is $\sim$ 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$
%Such a high density could be the product of shock compression or the entrainment of a high density primary wind.
%The beam-averaged CO column density at the lowest flow velocity is 50 times larger than that at the highest flow velocity, whereas the beam filling factor is only 2.5 times larger.
%So one or serveral of these parameters ($n_{\mathrm{H}_2}$, $dv/dr$ and $X_{\mathrm{CO}}$) must have decreased with outflow velocity. 
%Due to the lack of further information, it is unclear whether the CO abundance ratio or the velocity gradient has attributed to the decrease of CO column density at higher velocities. 
%A drop in $N_{\mathrm{CO}}$ at more extreme velocities indicates the decrease of one or serveral of these parameters. 
%To explore how the effect of beam dilution influence our results, we vary the beam filling factors from 0.2 to 1 and then perform the LVG analysis again. We find that modelling with different beam filling factors mainly affect the $N$-$V$ diagram, with minor change in the $T$-$V$ diagram and density limits. This could be resulted from the degeneracies of the beam filling factor with CO column density in the optically thin case. 

\subsection{The origin of the G240 outflow}
In a simple wide-angle wind-driven model, the gas temperature of the outflow is relatively constant, and the outflow density decreases with velocity and distance from the driving source \citep{1991ApJ...370L..31S, 2007prpl.conf..245A}. In contrast, the jet-driven bow shock model predicts that the gas temperature increases with outflow velocity.
Our analysis results agree with the wind-driven model. \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q} found that the kinematic structure and morphology of the G240 outflow can also be qualitatively interpreted by the wide-angle wind-driven model. Thus, we suggest that the G240 outflow is mainly driven/entrained by a wide-angle wind, which itself may resemble the accretion-driven wide-angle winds \citep[X-wind or disk winds:][]{2006ApJ...649..845S, 2006MNRAS.365.1131P} associated with low-mass YSOs, and we further suggest that disk-mediated accretion may exist in the formation of high-mass stars up to late-O types. It should be noted that most existing outflow models can only explain typical parameters of outflows driven by low-mass YSOs, and high-mass outflow models are necessary to quantitatively explain the physical conditions of outflows associated with high-mass YSOs. Statistical analyses of high-mass outflows are also essential for us to better understand the driven mechanism of massive outflows and the forming process of high-mass stars.
%We noticed that there are faint bow-shaped H$_{2}$ features near the source \objectname{IRAS 07427-2400} \citep{2002ApJ...576..313K}, indicating that jet-driven bow shocks may also contribute to the G240 outflow. Mid-J CO observations with higher resolution (e.g., with ALMA) are needed to study these suspicious bow shock features in detail.
%As molecular cooling is very efficient for the typical density and temperature of a wind-driven outflow, an isothermal state could be reached in typical wind-driven outflows.
%As molecular cooling dominates the cooling of the shocked material in the outflow at temperatures below 10$^4$ K \citep{1997IAUS..182..181H} and the cooling rate increases as $n^2$, molecular cooling is very efficient for the typical density of a wind-driven outflow. Thus, an isothermal state could be reached in a wind-driven outflow.
