\section{DISCUSSION}\label{discussion}

\subsection{Temperature}
From the LVG analysis and the population diagram analysis, constant temperatures of $\sim$ 50 K are found for both the blue lobe and red lobe. This value is consistent with temperatures in excess of 50 K probed by \citet{2016A&A...587A..17V} for outflows associated with intermediate mass protostars, but slightly lower than temperatures estimated in outflows associated with low-mass protostars \citep{2009A&A...501..633V, 2012A&A...542A..86Y}.

With priori assumption of other parameters, the kinetic temperature of the outflowing gas can be derived from LVG analysis using two CO lines. Thus, the $T-V$ relation in outflows can be studied. A rising trend of CO 3-2/6-5 ratio is observed towards the outflow gas associated with low-mass YSO HH46 \citep{2009A&A...501..633V}. If the density remains constant, the rising ratios observed at more extreme velocities could correspond to lower kinetic temperatures. In the case of outflowing gas toward low-mass protostars NGC 1333 IRAS 4A and  IRAS 4B, the CO 3-2/6-5 ratios are remarkably constant with velocity \citep{2012A&A...542A..86Y}. With the assumption of constant density, the constant ratio trend shows little or no evidence of a temperature change with velocity. Based on CO (2-1) and CO (3-2) observations towards the extremely high velocity (EHV) outflow of high-mass YSO G5.89-0.39, \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} assumed the canonical CO fractional abundance of 10$^{-4}$ and performed a LVG anylysis, revealing an increasing trend of temperature with gas velocity. However, using the CO (6-5), (7-6) and (16-15) lines, \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} performed a rotation diagram analysis towards G5.89-0.39 outflow and found a decreasing trend of excitation temperature with increasing velocities. This disagreement seen in results of \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} and \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} cound be due to different angular resolutions (3${\arcsec}$.4 compared to 14${\arcsec}$.5 ). While \citet{2012ApJ...744L..26S} has smaller energy range covered by their CO line observations ($\Delta$E$_u$ $\sim$ 17 K) compared to $\Delta$E$_u$ $\sim$ 600 K of \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L}, the decreasing trend of temperature with velocity constrained in \citet{2015A&A...584A..70L} is probably more appropriate for the G5.89-0.39 outflow. The different distributions of temperature with velocity reveal the complexity of molecular outflows. 

In the wide-angle wind model, a molecular outflow is the ambient material swept-up by a wide-angle radial wind. In previous numerical works, many authors chose isothermal equations for this model \citep{1996ApJ...472..211L,2001ApJ...557..429L}. Molecular cooling dominates the cooling of the shocked material in the outflow at temperatures below 10$^4$ K \citep{1997IAUS..182..181H}. As the cooling rate increases as $n^2$, molecular cooling is very efficient for the density of a wind-driven outflow. Thus, an isothermal state could be reached in a wind-driven outflow, with no temperature change with velocity. This is consistent with our derivation of almost constant temperature in the massive \objectname{G240} outflow. In addition, some other features of the molecular outflow associated with \objectname{G240} can also be qualitatively interpreted by the wide-angle wind model \citep{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, while other outflow models have different predictions of these features, as reviewed by \citet{2007prpl.conf..245A}. However, most outflow models existed have parameters typical of low-mass outflows. It is necessary to compare the observational results of high-mass outflows with models of similar physical conditions. Statics of outflows associated with high-mass star-forming regions are also essential for us to better understand the driven mechanism of massive outflows and the forming process of high-mass stars.

\subsection{Density}

The LVG analysis reveals thal the lower limits of gas densities are $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ at most velocities. We have found a decreasing trend of the beam averaged CO column density ($N_{\mathrm{CO,beam}}$)with gas velocity. As shown in Figure \ref{fig4b}, for each velocity bin, the beam averaged CO column density drops from $\sim 10^{16} $ cm$^{-2}$ to $5 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ within 15 km s$^{-1}$. In the optically thin case, the beam averaged CO column density could be related to gas density $n_{\mathrm{H}_2}$: 
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{CO,beam}} = n_{\mathrm{H}_2} \times \Delta V \times \frac{1}{dv/dr} \times X_{\mathrm{CO}} \times f_{\mathrm{b}}, 
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the beam filling factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}}$ the CO/H$_2$ abundance ratio, $\Delta V$ the velocity interval and $dv/dr$ is the velocity gradient. A drop in $N_{\mathrm{CO,beam}}$ at more extreme velocities indicates the decrease of one or serveral of these parameters. 

As shown in Figure 3 of \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, the source size are $\sim 20\arcsec$ and $\sim 10\arcsec$ at velocities of $\sim \pm$ 6 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim \pm$ 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the cloud velocity, corresponding to beam filling factors of $\sim$ 0.5 and $\sim$ 0.2, respectively. Considering the 2.5 times drop in the beam filling factor, the 20 times drop in the beam averaged CO column density is consistent with $\sim$ 8 times decrease in the CO column density. As shown in \citet{1995ApJ...455L.155S}, estimation from an x-wind model predict the wind density decreasing with velocity and distance from the driving source. Thus, the decrease of gas density could interpret the decrease of CO column density with velocity. Due to the lack of further informations, we cannot assess whether the CO abundance ratio or the velocity gradient has attributed to the drop of CO column density at high velocities.
