We present low and high angular resolution observations toward outflow gas of massive star forming region G240.31+0.07, with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) telescope in CO(2-1), and with Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in CO(3-2), (6-5), and (7-6). Integrated high velocity emissions of different transitions show similarity in morphology at the resolution of 19". For the first time with multi-transition CO lines, we find the relationship between outflowing gas temperature and velocity with Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) modeling. Our results reveal that the temperature of the outflowing gas has no obvious dependence on gas velocity, which favors the wide-angle wind model.
