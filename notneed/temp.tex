For (a)-(e), the contour levels are starting from 20\% and at steps of 10\%. For (f), the contour levels are starting from 30\% and at steps of 10\%.

However, we found the best fitting result at most velocities has a $\chi^2_{red}$ less than 1, indicating we might be a bit conservative at . So we adjusted the intensity uncertainties with a appropriate factor to 



Since the $^{13}$CO emission is not detected in the outflowing gas, the four transitions of $^{12}$CO are assumed to be 
optically thin during our analysis.
