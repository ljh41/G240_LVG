Bipolar molecular outflows are ubiquitous around low-mass and high-mass yound stellar objects (YSOs; e.g., Lada 1985; Fukui et al. 1993; Zhang et al. 2001; Beuther et al. 2002). Theoretical work suggests that,in low-mass star formation, molecular outflows are related to disk-accretion process, and they play an important role in dissipating excess angular momentum of the infalling material (Shu et al. 1987; Bachiller 1996). However, due to the rarity and the typically larger distances, massive molecular outflows and their driving sources are not well studied as their low-mass counterparts. Thus, it is not clear how the massive outflows are accelerated, how they differ from low-mass outflows, and how they affect the star forming process. It is essential to address these questions by studying individual high-mass star forming regions. 

Here we study G240.31+0.07 (hereafter G240), an active high-mass star formation region which is associated with the IRAS 07427-2400 source and located at a distance of 5.41 kpc (Sakai 2015). It harbors an ultracompact (UC) HII region and is reported to have OH and H2O* maser emission (Hughes&MacLeod 1993; Caswell 1997; MacLeod et al. 1998; Migenes et al. 1999; Caswell 2003). Its far-infrared luminosity of 10^4.7 L* is consistent with a O8.5 spectral type zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) star (MacLeod et al. 1998). An near-infrared study have found two bright elongated H2* emission knots near the source (Kumar et al. 2002). Kumar et al. (2003) further argued that the shocked H2* emission indicates the presence of a massive rotating disk or envelope around the luminous YSO IRAS 07427-2400. There are also millimeter and centimeter radio continuum observations towards G240. Two clumps were detected by Chen et al. (2007) at 654 GHz£¨460 um*), with clump A coinciding with a VLA 6 cm point source (Hughes & MacLeod 1993) and an H2O* maser. Qiu et al. (2009) presented a high resolution interferometric study at 1.3 mm and resolved the central part of G240 into three dusty cores MM1, MM2, and MM3, with the brightest core MM1 coinciding with the VLA 6 cm point source spatially. Trinidad (2011) presented observations at 1.3, 3.6, and 6 cm and reported radio continuum emission at the position of the three millimeter sources in at least one wavelength. G240 have also been mapped with single dish and interferometric observations in CO emission. High velocity CO (1-0) gas was detected towards G240 (McCutcheon et al. 1991; Shepherd & Churchwell 1996), tracing a bipolar outflow (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996). Hunter (1997) mapped the CO (3-2) emission with a 20" beam and found a prominent bipolar outflow at a position angle (PA) of 138* and a weaker component at PA ~* 101* . Kumar et al. (2003) also detected the prominent and weaker components of the bipolar CO (3-2) outflow with a 20" beam and reported the PA of the prominent component to be 132*. Recently, Qiu et al. (2009) presented a single dish and interferometric study of 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission and detected a bipolar, wide-angle, quasi-parabolic molecular outflow. In addition, Qiu et al. (2014) reported the detection of an hourglass magnetic field aligned within 20* of the outflow axis.


In this paper we present a CO multi transition (2-1, 3-2, 6-5, 7-6) study at the resolution of 20". With large velocity gradient (LVG) calculations, we explore the physical properties of the outflowing gas as a function of outflow velocity. We then discuss the driven mechanism of the outflow.
