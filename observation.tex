\section{OBSERVATIONS}

The observations were performed with the 12 m APEX telescope. The CO (3-2) tansition was observed in 200? using the ? receiver, whereas the CO (6-5) and CO (7-6) lines were observed simultaneously in 2009 with the CHAMP+ receiver. Pointings were checked by comparing these lines with the CO (2-1) data adopted from \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, and were found to be within $\sim 7\arcsec$ for CO (3-2) and within $\sim 4\arcsec$ for CO (6-5) and (7-6). The system temperatures were found to be ? at ? GHz. The ? spectrometer was used as the backend with a resolution of ? kHz (? km s$^{-1}$). The data was smoothed to 0.2 km s$^{-1}$, then the rms noise is of the order 0.03-0.05 K at 350 GHz, 0.15-0.25 K at 691 GHz and 0.40 - 0.60 K at 809 GHz. Beam efficiencies, determined by observations of planets, were 0.65, 0.41 and 0.40 at 345 GHz, 691 GHz and 809 GHz, respectively. The APEX beam sizes are $\sim 19\arcsec$ at 345 GHz, $\sim 9\arcsec$ at 691 GHz and $\sim 8\arcsec$ at 809 GHz. Calibration uncertainties are assumed to be 15 \%, 20\% and 30\% for the 345 GHz band, the 690 GHz band and the 800 GHz band, relatively. The CO (2-1) data were taken from \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q} and has a calibration uncertainty of 10 \%, with the rms estimated to be 0.06-0.10 K in 0.2 km s$^{-1}$ channels. Table \ref{tab:lines} shows a summary of the line informations.
