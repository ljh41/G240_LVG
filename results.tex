For (a)-(g), the contour levels start from 20\% and continue at steps of 10\% of the peak emission. For (h), the contour levels start from 30\% and continue at steps of 10\% of the peak emission. Data outside the dashed region are masked out because of the low signal-to-noise ratio. The black star marks the position of a H$_2$O maser spot which is associated with IRAS 07427-2400 \citep{2015PASJ...67...69S}. The beam of each observational dataset is shown in the lower right corner of each panel. \label{fig1}}

The cloud velocity (v$_{\mathrm{cloud}}$) with respect to the local standard of rest is $\sim$ 67.5 km s$^{-1}$ \citep{2003A&A...412..175K}. The CO (3-2), (6-5) emissions are detectable in velocity ranges from 42 km s$^{-1}$ to 94 km s$^{-1}$, and the CO (7-6) emission is detected in velocity ranges from 48 km s$^{-1}$ to 86 km s$^{-1}$. Figure \ref{fig1} shows the integrated low-velocity (LV) and high-velocity (HV) emissions of the four transitions. The outflow morphologies seen in CO (3-2), (6-5) and (7-6) are very similar: a prominent bipolar outflow at (PA) $\sim$ 131${\degr}$ along with a weaker component at PA $\sim$ 101${\degr}$ is detected. The weaker outflow component is only detected at low velocities, while the prominent component is detected at both low and high velocities. The signal-to-noise ratio in the CO (7-6) emission is relatively low at high velocities. Overall, the CO (3-2), (6-5), (7-6) maps presented in Figure \ref{fig1} are very similar to the CO (3-2) map presented by \citet{2003A&A...412..175K}. Due to the limit of angular resolution, the wide-angle structure highlighted by the CO (2-1) emission is not seen in the CO (3-2), (6-5), (7-6) maps.

\subsection{PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE OUTFLOW}
The physical conditions of the outflow could be constrained by comparing the observed line intensities with results of statistical-equilibrium calculations. Before the analysis, we convolved the CO (2-1), (6-5) and (7-6) maps to the same spatial resolution of the CO (3-2) map. The average rms noises are 0.004 K, 0.04 K and 0.10 K for the convolved CO (2-1), (6-5) and (7-6) data, respectively. The CO fluxes were then calculated at (R.A., decl.)$_{J2000}$ = ($07^h44^m52^s.4, -24^d7^m53^s.8$) and (R.A., decl.)$_{J2000}$ = ($07^h44^m51^s.3, -24^d7^m34^s.6$) (marked as two crosses in each panel of Figure \ref{fig1}). The two positions are roughly the peak of the high velocity components of each lobe of the convolved maps of the four transitions. We note that the offsets of the peak positions are within $\sim$ 3$\arcsec$ for different lines at different velocities. To avoid contaminations from the ambient gas, we limited our analysis to velocity ranges of $\le$ 60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\ge$ 74 km s$^{-1}$. And we only focused on the data with high signal-to-noise ratios in velocities ranges of $\ge$ 48 km s$^{-1}$ and $\le$ 86 km s$^{-1}$. Figure \ref{fig2} shows the observed line wing ratios of main-beam temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{mb}}$) of different CO transitions.  All line ratios in Figure \ref{fig2} are remarkably constant with velocity. Because the $^{13}$CO emission is only marginally detected in the outflowing gas, the four transitions of $^{12}$CO were assumed to be optically thin during our analysis. The uncertainty of the observed intensity mainly consists of two parts: the calibration error and the rms noise. At low velocities, the calibration uncertainty dominates the intensity uncertainty, whereas the rms noise is dominant at high velocities. A combination of the rms noise and the calibration error $\sigma_{obs} = (\sigma_{cal}^2 + \sigma_{rms}^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ was used as the observational uncertainty in the belowing analysis.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\plotone{./fig/ratio.eps}
\caption{Ratios of main-beam temperatures of different CO lines at different velocities. Blue symbols denote the measurements from the blueshifted lobe, and red symbols the redshifted lobe. The $V_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ shown here is related to the cloud velocity $v_{\mathrm{cloud}}$ by the relation: $V_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ = $\mid$ $v_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ - $v_{\mathrm{cloud}}\mid$, where $v_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ is the outflow velocity with respect to the local standard of rest. \label{fig2}}
\end{figure}

Firstly, we performed a simple rotation diagram (RD) analysis \citep{1999ApJ...517..209G} to estimate the excitation conditions of the outflowing gas in each velocity interval under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE). The population of each level is given by 
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{up}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{CO}}{Z} g_\mathrm{up} e^{-E_\mathrm{up}/kT_\mathrm{kin}},
\end{equation}
where $N_\mathrm{up}$ is the column density in the upper state, $g_\mathrm{up}$ the statistical weight of the upper state, $E_\mathrm{up}$ the upper energy level, $k$ the Boltzmann constant, and Z is the partition function.
The rotation diagram for CO at 82 km s$^{-1}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig3} as an example. It should be noted that the different molecular energy levels could be reproduced with a single-component excitation condition, indicating that the four transitions probe the same volume of gas. Similar rotation diagrams were found at other velocities. 

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\caption{A rotation diagram for CO at 82 km s$^{-1}$.  The fitted line shows the Boltzmann distribution of the rotational populations. The black solid circles show the data with error bars. \label{fig3}}
\end{figure}

Then the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX code \citep{2007A&A...468..627V} was used to better constrain the gas density ($n_{\mathrm{H}_2}$), the kinetic temperature ($T_{\mathrm{kin}}$) and the CO column density ($N_{\mathrm{CO}}$) of the outflowing gas in each 2 km s$^{-1}$ bin. The best fit was obtained by minimizing the $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ between the observed intensities and the model intensities. With four lines observed and three parameters to constrain, our fitting has one degree of freedom. We didn't correct our observed intensities with beam-filling factors. Thus, the derived physical parameters are the average values over the beam.  In Figure \ref{fig:fig4}, the fitting results at 82 km s$^{-1}$ is shown as examples of the $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ distribution. Similar $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ distributions were found at other velocities. The $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ has only one minimum in [$T$, $N$] planes, where as the $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ distribution in the [$T$, $n$] and [$n$, $N$] planes show that the gas is thermalized and no upper limits to the density could be derived. The $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ of the best fitting results varies from 0.10 to 1.72 at different velocities. Though the best-fitted $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ have different values at different velocities, the $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ distributions show similarity in morphology, indicating that the uncertainties of the fitted parameters may have similar level at different velocities. So we derive the uncertainties of each parameter of the LVG analysis from the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the $N$-$T$-$n$ 3-dimensional space at the velocities where $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} \sim 1$ as the representative uncertainties of the fitted parameters. The 1$\sigma$ confidence range of temperatures is about 40 K - 60 K. The lower limit of gas density ($n_{\mathrm{lower}}$) is around 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$. The uncertainty of the CO column densitiy is $\sim$ 10 \%.

The $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ of the best fitting result is $\sim$1.00 at 82 km s$^{-1}$. The Solid white contours show the 1$\sigma$ confidence levels. \label{fig:fig4}}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:fig5} shows the outflowing gas temperature and the CO column density as functions of gas velocity, estimated from the LVG analysiss and the rotation diagram analysis. The $N$-$V$ diagram shows a clear decreasing trend of CO column density with outflow velocity, while the $T$-$V$ diagram shows that the gas temperature has no obvious dependence on gas velocity. The $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ calculated from the LVG analysis are shown in the $N$-$V$ diagram.

\end{figure*}

We then performed the LVG analysis and RD analysis again with the line intensities calculated from several different positions and got similar results with previous analysis with the intensities calculated from the peak position. Thus, we exclude the systematic bias from the choice of positions for measuring the line intensities.
