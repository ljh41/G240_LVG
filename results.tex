For (a)-(g), the contour levels start from 20\% and continue at steps of 10\% of the peak emission. For (h), the contour levels start from 30\% and continue at steps of 10\% of the peak emission. Edge channels are masked out because of high noise levels. The black star marks the position of a H$_2$O maser spot which is associated with IRAS 07427-2400 \citep{2015PASJ...67...69S}. The beam of each observational dataset is shown in the lower right corner of each panel. \label{fig:figcontour}}
\end{figure*}

The CO J = 3-2, 6-5, and 7-6 emissions are detected (with obvious outflow signatures and with peak intensities $>$ 2 $\sigma_{rms}$) in velocity ranges from 42 to 94 km s$^{-1}$, 44 to 92 km s$^{-1}$, and 46 to 90 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:figcontour} shows the integrated low-velocity (LV) and high-velocity (HV) emissions of the four lines. The velocity ranges chosen to highlight the LV and HV components of the outflowing gas follow those in \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, except that the channels with no detections were excluded for the HV component. The morphologies of the bipolar outflow seen in the CO J = 3-2, 6-5, and 7-6 lines are very similar. Due to the coarser angular resolutions, the wide-angle structure seen in the higher resolution CO J = 2-1 image is not seen in the CO J = 3-2, 6-5, and 7-6 maps.

\subsection{Physical conditions of the outflow}
%\subsubsection{Methodology}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\plotone{./fig/ratio.eps}
\caption{Ratios of the main-beam temperatures of different CO lines at different velocities. Blue symbols denote the measurements from the blueshifted lobe, and red symbols the redshifted lobe. The $V_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ shown here is related to the cloud velocity $v_{\mathrm{cloud}}$ by the relation: $V_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ = $\mid$ $v_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ - $v_{\mathrm{cloud}}\mid$, where $v_{\mathrm{outflow}}$ is the outflow velocity with respect to the local standard of rest. \label{fig:figratio}}
\end{figure}

The physical condition of the outflow can be constrained by comparing the observed line intensities with the results of statistical-equilibrium calculations. To study the four lines at the same spatial resolution, the CO J = 2-1, 6-5, and 7-6 maps were reconstructed with the same beam of the CO J = 3-2 map. The rms noise levels are $\sim$0.004 K, $\sim$0.04 K and $\sim$0.1 K for the convolved CO J = 2-1, 6-5 and 7-6 data, respectively. For both lobes of the outflow, the CO line intensities were measured at approximately the peak positions of the HV components of the convolved CO maps (marked as two crosses in every panel of Figure \ref{fig:figcontour}), and were then used in the following analysis. Figure \ref{fig:figratio} shows the ratios of the main-beam temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{mb}}$) of different CO lines as functions of velocity. The CO 7-6/6-5, 6-5/3-2, and 6-5/2-1 ratios are almost constant over a velocity range of $\sim 5-25$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the cloud velocity, with ratio variations of $<$30 $\%$. The typical values of the 7-6/6-5, 6-5/3-2, and 6-5/2-1 ratios are $\sim$0.6, $\sim$0.7, and $\sim$1.0, respectively. In the analysis, we only used channels of $\le$ 60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\ge$ 74 km s$^{-1}$ to avoid contaminations from the ambient gas, and we excluded channels of $<$ 46 km s$^{-1}$ or $>$ 90 km s$^{-1}$ because of their low signal-to-noise ratios. Since we didn't correct the observed line intensities for unknown beam filling factors, the derived CO column densitiy ($N$), gas temperature ($T$), and gas density ($n$) should be considered as beam-averaged values. In the calculation, errors on line intensities took into account both the uncertainties of the flux calibration uncertainty and the rms noise. 
%(R.A., decl.)$_{J2000}$ = ($07^h44^m52^s.4, -24^d7^m53^s.8$) and (R.A., decl.)$_{J2000}$ = ($07^h44^m51^s.3, -24^d7^m34^s.6$)
%We note that the offsets of the peak positions are within $\sim$ 3$\arcsec$ for different lines at different velocities.
%The uncertainty of the observed intensity mainly consists of two parts: the calibration error and the rms noise. At low velocities, the calibration uncertainty dominates the intensity uncertainty, whereas the rms noise is dominant at high velocities. A combination of the rms noise and the calibration error $\sigma_{obs} = (\sigma_{cal}^2 + \sigma_{rms}^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ was used as the observational uncertainty in the belowing analyses.
%errors take into account both the rms noise and the calibration uncertainties.

%\subsubsection{Rotation diagram analysis\label{subsec:RD}}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\plotone{./fig/RD.eps}
\caption{A rotation diagram for CO at 84 km s$^{-1}$. The fitted line shows the Boltzmann distribution of the rotational populations. The line represents a rotational temperature of 48.5 K and a total column density of 2.0 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. The black solid circles show the data with error bars. \label{fig:figrd}}
\end{figure}

We first performed a simple rotation diagram (RD) analysis \citep{1999ApJ...517..209G} to estimate the excitation condition of the outflowing gas under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE). Considering that the $^{13}$CO J = 2-1 emission was only marginally detected or not detected at our considered velocities \citep{2009ApJ...696...66Q}, we assumed the four $^{12}$CO lines to be optically thin. The population of each energy level is given by 
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{up}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{CO}}{Z} g_\mathrm{up} e^{-E_\mathrm{up}/kT_\mathrm{kin}},
\end{equation}
where $N_\mathrm{up}$ is the column density in the upper state, $g_\mathrm{up}$ the statistical weight of the upper state, $E_\mathrm{up}$ the upper energy level, $k$ the Boltzmann constant, and $Z$ is the partition function. The rotation diagram for CO at 84 km s$^{-1}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figrd} as an example. An LTE model at 48.5 K could account for the measurements from the four lines. Other velocity channels show similar rotation diagrams.

%\subsubsection{Large velocity gradient analysis\label{subsec:LVG}}

\begin{figure*}[!tbp]

      }
\caption{(a)-(c) The $\chi^2$ distribution at 84 km s$^{-1}$ in the [$T$, $n$], [$T$, $N$] and [$n$, $N$] planes, with the third parameter fixed to the value of the best fitting result at this velocity. The lower limit of gas density is 1.8 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. The best-fit solution is obtained for $T$ =  46.1 K and $N$ = 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. The $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ of the best-fit solution is 1.00. The Solid white contours show the 1$\sigma$ confidence levels. \label{fig:figchi}}
\end{figure*}

To better constrain the gas temperature, the density, and the CO column density without assuming LTE and optical thin emission, we then performed radiative transfer calculations of the four lines using the RADEX code, which adopts the LVG approximation \citep{2007A&A...468..627V}. We built a large grid of LVG models by varying the three parameters ($n$, $T$ and $N$), and obtained the best fitting results by $\chi^2$ minimization in comparing the observation with the models. With four lines observed and three parameters to constrain, our fitting had one degree of freedom. In Figure \ref{fig:figchi}, the fitting results at 84 km s$^{-1}$ are shown. Figure \ref{fig:figchi}(a) and Figure \ref{fig:figchi}(b) show that the gas temperature is well constrained to $\sim$ 50 K. In Figures \ref{fig:figchi}(b) and \ref{fig:figchi}(c), the CO column density is stringently constrained to 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. The $\chi^2$ distribution in Figure \ref{fig:figchi}(a) and \ref{fig:figchi}(c) indicate that in the best LVG models, the gas density is high enough to thermalize the emissions, and thus only lower limits of the gas density could be derived from the $\chi^2$ minimization. This implies that the LTE assumption adopted by the above RD analysis is valid, and hence we obtain similar gas temperatures and CO column densities from the RD and LVG analyses. Similar $\chi^2$ distribution patterns were found at other velocities. The reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$) of the best fitting results varies from 0.10 to 1.72 at different velocities. The representative uncertainty of each parameter is derived from the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the 3D parameter space at the velocities where $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} \sim 1$: the relative uncertainty of the CO column density is $\sim$ 10 \%; the temperature uncertainty is $\sim$10 K; and the gas density is $>$ 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ over the entire velocity range. The modeling results also predict that the four transitions are optically thin in the outflowing gas. Figure \ref{fig:figsed} shows the comparison of the observed CO intensities with the LVG modeling results in each velocity bin. The best fitting solution can well account for the emission of the four lines.
% Though the best-fitted $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ varies, the $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}$ distribution profiles show similarity in morphology at different velocities, indicating that the uncertainties of the fitted parameters may have similar levels at different velocities.

%\subsubsection{$T$-$V$ and $N$-$V$ relations}

\begin{figure*}[!tbp]
\gridline{\fig{./fig/tv_paper.eps}{0.5\textwidth}{(a)}

\caption{$T$-$V$ and $N$-$V$ diagrams of the G240 outflow, estimated from the rotation diagram analysis (blue ``x'' markers for the blue lobe and red ``x'' markers for the red lobe) and the LVG analysis (blue open squares for the blue lobe and red open squares for the red lobe). \label{fig:figrelation}}
\end{figure*}

The variation of the physical conditions of the outflowing gas as a function of velocity is of great interests to our understanding of the driving mechanism of the outflow. With the RD and LVG analyses we have estimated the gas temperature, density and CO column density at different velocities. Figure \ref{fig:figrelation} shows the temperature-velocity ($T$-$V$) and CO column density-velocity ($N$-$V$) relations. In Figure \ref{fig:figrelation}(a), the $T$-$V$ diagram shows that the emission of the outflow is well accounted for by gas with a temperature of $\sim$50 K. The temperature variation of $<$10 K is within the expected uncertainties, indicating that the outflowing gas is approximately isothermal. Figure \ref{fig:figrelation}(b) shows a clear decreasing trend of CO column density with outflow velocity, with the CO column density in each 2 km s$^{-1}$ bin ranging from $\sim 2 \times 10^{16} $ cm$^{-2}$ to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ within the outflow velocity range of $\sim \pm$ 7 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim \pm$ 22 km s$^{-1}$. We performed RD and LVG analyses of the CO lines in different positions, and obtained similar $T$-$V$ and $N$-$V$ relations. Thus, we feel confident that the derived $T$-$V$ and $N$-$V$ trends are not affected by the systematic bias of position offsets.
%Thus, a systematic bias of position offsets was excluded.
%In Figure \ref{fig:figrelation}, the $T$-$V$ diagram shows that the gas is approximately isothermal with a gas temperature of $\sim$ 50 K, while the $N$-$V$ diagram shows that the CO column density in each 2 km s$^{-1}$ bin decreases from $\sim 2 \times 10^{16} $ cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim \pm$ 7 km s$^{-1}$ down to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim \pm$ 22 km s$^{-1}$. We compared the model intensities with line intensities measured at several different positions, and found that the modeling results are similar to those represented in Figure \ref{fig:figrelation}. Thus, a systematic bias of position offsets was excluded.
%Thus, we exclude the systematic bias from choices of positions for measuring the line intensities.
