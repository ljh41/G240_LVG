\section{INTRODUCTION}
Highly-collimated high-velocity jets of atomic and/or molecular gas and less collimated low-velocity molecular outflows, which trace the accretion-powered ejections during star formation, are common phenomena associated with young stellar objects (YSOs) of all masses\citep{ 1985ARA&A..23..267L,1993prpl.conf..603F, 2001ApJ...552L.167Z,2002A&A...383..892B, 2004A&A...426..503W, 2006A&A...453..785F, 2007prpl.conf..245A, 2015MNRAS.453..645M}. It is believed that the high-velocity jets are launched near a protostar while the dirven mechanism of molecular outflows remains unknown. There are several outflow models on simulation outflows from low-mass protostars: molecular outflows can be entrained by a wide-angle wind \citep{1991ApJ...370L..31S,1996ApJ...472..211L, 2001ApJ...557..429L}, or by a jet bow shock \citep{ 1993A&A...278..267R, 1993ApJ...414..230M, 2001ApJ...557..429L}. In sites of low-mass star formation, molecular outflows involve amounts of energy similar to those involved in the accretion processes and are indispensable for dissipating excess angular momentum of accretion disks \citep{1987ARA&A..25...23S, 1996ARA&A..34..111B}. Given the fact that protostellar jets/winds can continuously inject momentum into supersonic turbulence to keep the could from collapsing, protostellar jets/winds are essential to explain the low star formation efficiency in turbulent clouds. Protostellar jets/winds also play a key role in determining the core-to-star efficiencies \citep{2014prpl.conf..451F}. Thus, molecular outflows and protostellar jets/winds are a fundamental part of the formation process of low mass stars. Due to the rarity and typically larger distances, the case of massive molecular outflows is more problemtic than their low-mass counterparts. And there is little work on simulation outflows from high-mass YSOs. Many questions, e.g., how the outflows from massive YSOs are accelerated, how they differ from low-mass outflows, and how they affect the high-mass star-forming processes, are still unanswered. It is essential to address these questions by studying individual outflows associated with high-mass star-forming regions. 

Most previous studies of outflows have used low-J rotational transitions of CO (transitions up to J$_u$ = 4, with upper-state energies E$_u$ < 50 K), which are easily excited at low temperatures, to characterize the relatively cold and extended molecular gas in morphology and kinematics \citep{1998ApJ...507..861S, 2004ApJ...604..258S, 2008ApJ...675..454Y, 2009ApJ...696...66Q, 2009A&A...495..169S, 2013ApJ...774...39A, 2016ApJ...832..158Z}. These low-J CO emission lines can be easily observed from the ground-based facilities. Due to atmospheric limits, observations of mid-J CO lines (referring to CO (6-5) and CO (7-6) throughout this paper), which are less affected by ambient gas and can probe the warm and/or dense gas, are very rare. To derive the physical parameters of the outflowing gas, sensitive observations of CO across multiple transitions are needed. 

This paper is a follow-up study of the \objectname{G240.31+0.07} (hereafter \objectname{G240}) outflow \citep{2009ApJ...696...66Q}. Here we report the 12-m submillimeter Atacama Pathfinder Experiment Telescope\footnote{    The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment Telescope is a collaboration between the Max-Planck-Institut f"ur Radioastronomie, the European Southern Observatory, and the Onsala Space Observatory.} (APEX) observations of \objectname{G240}, an active high-mass star-forming region which is associated with the young stellar object (YSO) \objectname{IRAS 07427-2400} and located at a distance of 5.41 kpc \citep{2015PASJ...67...69S}. It harbors an ultracompact HII region and is associated with OH and H$_2$O masers \citep{1993AJ....105.1495H,1997MNRAS.289..203C,1998AJ....116.1897M,1999ApJS..123..487M,2003MNRAS.341..551C}. Its far-infrared luminosity of 10$^{4.7}$ L$_\sun$ is consistent with a spectral type O8.5 zero-age main-sequence star \citep{1998AJ....116.1897M}. A near-infrared study has found two bright elongated H$_2$ emission knots near the source \citep{2002ApJ...576..313K}. \citet{2003A&A...412..175K} further argued that the shocked H$_2$ emission indicates the presence of a massive rotating disk/envelope around the luminous YSO \objectname{IRAS 07427-2400}. 

There are also millimeter and centimeter radio continuum observations toward \objectname{G240}. Two clumps were detected by \citet{2007ApJ...654L..87C} at 654 GHz (460 $\mu$m), with clump A coinciding with a VLA 6 cm point source \citep{1993AJ....105.1495H} and an H$_2$O maser. \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q} presented a high resolution interferometric study at 1.3 mm and resolved the central part of \objectname{G240} into three dusty cores MM1, MM2, and MM3, with the brightest core MM1 coinciding with the VLA 6 cm point source spatially. \citet{2011AJ....142..147T} presented observations at 1.3, 3.6, and 6 cm and reported radio continuum emissions at the position of the three millimeter sources in at least one wavelength.

\objectname{G240} has also been mapped with single dish and interferometric observations in CO emission. High-velocity CO (1-0) gas was detected towards \objectname{G240} \citep{1991AJ....101.1435M,1996ApJ...457..267S}, tracing a bipolar outflow \citep{1996ApJ...457..267S}. \citet{1997PhDT........21H} mapped the CO (3-2) emission with a 20${\arcsec}$ beam and found a prominent bipolar outflow at a position angle (PA) of 138${\degr}$ and a weaker component at PA $\sim$ 101${\degr}$. \citet{2003A&A...412..175K} also detected a prominent component and a weaker component of the bipolar CO (3-2) outflow with a 20${\arcsec}$ beam and reported the PA of the prominent component to be 132${\degr}$. Recently, \citet{2009ApJ...696...66Q} presented a detailed single dish and interferometric study of $^{12}$CO (2-1) and $^{13}$CO (2-1) emission and detected a bipolar, wide-angle, quasi-parabolic molecular outflow. 

In addition, \citet{2014ApJ...794L..18Q} reported the detection of an hourglass magnetic field aligned within 20${\degr}$ of the outflow axis.

In this paper, we present a CO multi-transition (3-2, 6-5, 7-6) study towards the \objectname{G240} outflow. With large velocity gradient (LVG) calculations and rotation diagram (RD) analysis, we estimate the physical parameters of the outflow as a function of gas velocity. We then discuss the results of the analysis.
